/**
 * Single source of truth for paths that require authentication.
 *
 * Two pieces of the app gate access against this list:
 *  - `proxy.ts` (middleware): when an unauthenticated request hits one of
 *    these paths, the middleware sets `x-auth-required: true` and lets the
 *    request continue so the page can render a placeholder.
 *  - `AutoLoginModalTrigger` (client): on these paths, when the session is
 *    `unauthenticated`, the login modal is opened automatically.
 *
 * Both pieces must agree on the list — otherwise the modal opens without a
 * placeholder (or vice versa). Adding a new protected route is a one-line
 * change here.
